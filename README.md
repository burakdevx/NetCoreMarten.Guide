üí° In this project, the proof of concept of the Marten library was made with .net core 6. The project is entirely aimed at using and understanding the basic features of the Marten library.

‚ö°Angular was used on the UI side of the project.You can install and experience the application on your computer using [docker-compose](https://github.com/burakdevx/NetCoreMarten.Guide/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

‚ùó‚ùïThe application requires a postgresql database.If you run docker-compose first, the postgresql database and container will already be running.
